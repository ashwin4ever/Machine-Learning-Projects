**Probelm:**  
To classify the correct drug type given different features. This falls under *Multiclass Classification* type of classification problems.

**Data Information:**
The data set contains various information that effect the predictions like Age, Sex, BP, Cholesterol levels, Na to Potassium Ratio and finally the drug type.  

**Data Attributes**
* Age
* Sex
* Blood Pressure Levels
* Cholesterol Levels
* Na to Potassium Ratio

**Target Feature**
* Drug Type

**Running the code:**
* Download the notebook and the dataset *drug200.csv* and run it in your local broswer or open the notebook to view the code.


**Methods**  
The dataset comprises of 5 features and exploratory data analysis like visualizing joint distribution of features using strip plots and box plots have been performed to derive feature importance. Logistic regression is used to perform multiclass classification.
